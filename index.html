        <p class="letter">
            I just wanted to let you know that you are someone really special to me. Whenever I see you, my heart skips a beat and I can't help but smile. You bring so much joy and happiness into my life, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you around. <br><br>
            And I can't stop thinking about how wonderful you are. <br><br>
            I hope we can spend more time together and create beautiful memories. <br><br>
            Your geekfreek,<br>
